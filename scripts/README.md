Selenium / Jenkins / Allure
======================


This repository is all about creating automated testing scripts and how to run them on a nightly basis in a **Continuous integration environment**.  The following tools and conventions are used throughout this repository and finally being executed via shell script in Jenkins.

----------

1. Selenium WebDriver
-------------

WebDriver is an open source tool for automated testing of webapps across many browsers. It provides capabilities for navigating to web pages, user input, JavaScript execution, and more.  If you wish to create automated tests and monitor the quality of your product,  Selenium WebDriver is one of the top tools to achieve exactly that.

2. Python & WebDriver
-------------

Selenium Python bindings provides a simple API to write functional/acceptance tests using Selenium WebDriver. Through Selenium Python API you can access all functionalities of Selenium WebDriver in an intuitive way.

Selenium Python bindings provide a convenient API to access Selenium WebDrivers like Firefox, Ie, Chrome, Remote etc. The current supported Python versions are 2.7, 3.2 and above.

PyTest
-------------

The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

Virtual Environment
-------------

A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places, by creating virtual Python environments for them. It solves the “Project X depends on version 1.x but, Project Y needs 4.x” dilemma, and keeps your global site-packages directory clean and manageable.

Requirements.txt
-------------

requirements-txt - generate requirements.txt (python packages)

Jenkins
-------------

Jenkins is an award-winning, cross-platform, continuous integration and continuous delivery application that increases your productivity. Use Jenkins to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously deliver your software by providing powerful ways to define your build pipelines and integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.
